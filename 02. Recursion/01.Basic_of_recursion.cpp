# Recursion

The process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly is called 
recursion and the corresponding function is called as recursive function. 
Using recursive algorithm, certain problems can be solved quite easily. 
Examples of such problems are Towers of Hanoi (TOH), Inorder/Preorder/Postorder
Tree Traversals, DFS of Graph, etc.


Type:
A. Direct Recursion
1.head recursion
2.tail recursion
3.tree recursion
4.nested recursion

B.Indirect recursion
